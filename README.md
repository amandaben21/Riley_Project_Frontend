> This app is dedicated to my bunny Riley who passed away this June 2021. The Riley Project is for people who foster bunnies and is trying to find a warm and loving family who will accept and love a bunny as their own, accepting them into their family. This site will allow the foster homes to post up bunnies that are available for adoption.
